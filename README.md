- Save creates a new revision. You can add a brief changelog message to each revision.
- Use the History tab to view prior revisions. Select any two revisions to view diffs.
- Approve or reject community edits if you run a local moderator role.
- Export pages to JSON for offline backup or sharing.

Content format and templates
The wiki uses a structured format to keep pages consistent. Each page uses a front-matter block with metadata, followed by content.

Example front-matter fields
- title: Page title
- type: api | guide | tutorial | asset
- tags: list of tags
- version: API version
- authors: list of contributors
- example: path to sample code
- license: page-level license

Page body
- Use headings for structure.
- Use fenced code blocks for code samples.
- Use API tables for properties, methods, and events.

API reference layout
API pages follow a strict layout:
- Header with class name and class link.
- Short description that states use cases.
- Constructors and creation patterns.
- Members section divided into Properties, Methods, and Events.
- Examples section with runnable code snippet when possible.
- See also links to related classes and services.
- Version and change log section.

Example: Instance page (excerpt)
- Class: Instance
- Description: Base object for objects in the Roblox data model.
- Properties: Name, Parent
- Methods: FindFirstChild, WaitForChild
- Events: AncestryChanged
- Example: Creating and parenting objects.

Code samples and snippets
The wiki bundles many code snippets. Each snippet includes:
- A short description of what the code does.
- Minimal working example.
- Notes about edge cases and common errors.
- Test cases to validate logic.

Sample snippet: Basic RemoteEvent use
- Server:
  local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
  local REMOTE = Instance.new("RemoteEvent", ReplicatedStorage)
  REMOTE.Name = "Ping"

  REMOTE.OnServerEvent:Connect(function(player, message)
    print(player.Name, message)
  end)

- Client:
  local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
  local REMOTE = ReplicatedStorage:WaitForChild("Ping")
  REMOTE:FireServer("hello")

Search, indexing, and metadata
- The app builds a full-text index and stores it locally.
- Indexing runs on first launch and when you add new pages.
- You can limit search by section, tag, type, or author.
- Use quotes to search exact phrases.
- Use the advanced filter to find API entries with a given property or method.

Plugin and extension system
The app includes a plugin API that allows community features:
- UI panels for in-app tools.
- Index handlers to add custom content sources.
- Page processors for new markup types.
- Export adapters for new formats.

Plugin example: linting plugin
- A plugin runs on save.
- It checks code blocks for syntax errors.
- It highlights lines and shows quick fixes.

Plugin security
- Plugins run in a sandbox.
- Plugins request explicit permissions before using file-system or network APIs.
- You can revoke plugin permissions in Settings.

Security and file handling
- Pages and revisions store on disk in a sandboxed folder within the app data path.
- The app enforces a content size cap per page to prevent runaway files.
- Exported ZIP and JSON files use safe names and validate file paths before writing.
- The code runner executes Luau in a sandbox with no direct file or network I/O.

Testing and validation
- The app includes unit tests for core parsers and the search index.
- Use the test runner to validate new pages and templates.
- Example test: code sample must parse and run in the sandbox without exceptions.
- The app includes a test mode that loads test pages and fails on parser errors.

Development workflow
- Clone the repository.
- Install the dev toolchain: Node for the UI build system, and a lightweight bundler.
- Run the local dev server to preview content.
- Add a new page under content/ with the correct front-matter.
- Run tests: npm test
- Build the installer with the provided build script.

Example local dev steps
- git clone https://github.com/Juansasj/Roblox-Wiki.git
- cd Roblox-Wiki
- npm ci
- npm run dev
- Open http://localhost:3000

Localization
- The app supports multiple languages.
- Use translation files in the i18n folder.
- Each page can include translations via the front-matter.
- Translation workflow:
  - Add keys for new strings.
  - Create a translation file for the locale.
  - Run the export-translations script.
- The UI adapts to locale settings and uses fallback when translations are missing.

Accessibility
- The UI follows ARIA best practices.
- All interactive elements have keyboard focus states.
- The editor supports high-contrast mode and a large-font mode.
- Screen reader labels exist for search, edit, and navigation controls.

Roadmap
- Add collaborative editing with a sync backend.
- Add a plugin marketplace.
- Add support for expanded export formats like EPUB.
- Add richer code runner with step-through debugging.
- Improve the content import from the official Roblox documentation.

Troubleshooting and FAQ
Q: The index build stalls on first run.  
A: Check disk space and allow the app to finish. The index builder retries failures.

Q: The code runner shows a permission error.  
A: Open Settings and enable sandboxed code execution. The code runner refuses actions that touch local files.

Q: How do I restore a deleted page?  
A: Use the History view to find the last revision. Click Restore.

Q: How do I update the app?  
A: Visit the releases page and download the latest installer: https://github.com/Juansasj/Roblox-Wiki/releases. Run the installer to update.

Q: The search returns irrelevant results.  
A: Rebuild the index from Settings -> Rebuild Index.

Q: I want a plugin to access an API. How do I allow it?  
A: Grant permissions during plugin install. Permissions appear in Settings -> Plugins.
